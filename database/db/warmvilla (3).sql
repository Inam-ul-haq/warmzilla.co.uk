The Alpha E-Tec Plus combi boiler will cost you around &pound;1200 just for the boiler alone without installation and all the extras you get with a WarmZilla boiler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boilers sold by WarmZilla come with Gas Safe installation, system filter, system cleanse, inhibitor, wireless thermostat, up to 12 years guarantee, any flues or extension kits you may need; plus, if your condensate or gas pipes require upgrading - that&rsquo;s included in your fixed price boiler quote too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warmzilla.co.uk/find-a-boiler&quot;&gt;get a quote now&lt;/a&gt; on a new boiler with all the extras mentioned above, in a few minutes using the WarmZilla online survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 'Compare Alpha  Boiler | WarmZilla', 'Use the WarmZilla boiler comparison tool to compare any Alpha boiler against each other or any other boiler brand to see which is best for your home.', '2021-04-30 04:13:46', '2021-07-24 08:27:52'),

This is why they are also known as traditional or conventional boilers.</p><p><br></p><p>Regular boilers require a cold water tank in the attic, in addition to a hot water storage cylinder, usually in an airing cupboard. Due to the space these tanks take up, the combi boiler has become the preferred choice of boiler type in the U.K.</p><p><br>If your home is short of space, or you would like to convert your loft space, then having a regular boiler would be less desirable than a combi. Combi boilers work by heating water directly from the mains water supply, they also supply the central heating and hot water from one compact unit.</p><p><br>If you have a high hot water demand in your home and you would like to be able to supply hot water to two bathrooms at the same time then this is where you might prefer a regular boiler. As the water is preheated and stored in a tank, there is plenty of hot water to use and there is no loss of pressure. However, when the stored water is used up, you’ll have to wait hours for the tank to be refilled with hot water or risk having a tepid bath!</p><p><br>Unlike a combi boiler which heats water on demand, a regular boiler stores the hot water. While this hot water is stored there is inevitably some heat loss that occurs, making regular boilers less energy-efficient.</p><p><br>Most homes in the U.K choose to have a combi boiler fitted, you can choose to convert your regular boiler to a combi boiler when you complete the <a href=\"https://www.warmzilla.co.uk/find-a-boiler\" target=\"_blank\">WarmZilla online survey</a> to get your boiler quote. It only takes a few minutes and you’ll be given a selection of boilers to suit your home. </p> <br><h2>How does a <font color=\"#ff9c00\">regular</font> boiler work?</h2><p>Regular boilers work slightly differently from a combi boiler.

(32, 'systemboiler_questions', '<p></p><h2>What is a <font color=\"#ff9c00\">system</font> boiler?</h2><p>A system boiler is a boiler type, like a combination boiler or a regular boiler, that is more commonly found in larger homes with a higher demand for heating and hot water.</p><p><br>System boilers have a separate hot water storage tank which allows a system boiler to store hot water so that it’s ready on demand. If you aren\'t sure <a href=\"https://www.warmzilla.co.uk/blog/boiler-types-explained\" target=\"_blank\">what boiler type</a> you have, we\'ve written a blog covering it to help you out.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>Due to a system boiler storing hot water, it means that they are able to provide a constant supply of hot water to multiple outlets in your home at the same time. So if you have two bathrooms with taps and showers running, you will still have hot water in both and the water pressure will not be affected.</p><p><br></p><h2>How does a <font color=\"#ff9c00\">system</font> boiler <font color=\"#ff9c00\">work</font>?</h2><p>Despite combi boilers being the most popular boiler type in the U.K, there is still a place for the system boiler. A system boiler setup comprises the system boiler itself and a hot water storage tank.<br></p><p><br></p><p>As with a combi boiler, a system boiler is connected to the mains water feed, heating water directly as it comes into your property. Once a system boiler heats water via the heat exchanger, it is pumped into the hot water storage tank, so you have a nice amount of hot water ready and waiting.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>A combi boiler heats water on demand, when you turn on a hot water tap it will heat the water instantly. Combi boilers do have a small reservoir of hot water stored within the boiler but not the same volume as a system boiler.</p><p><br>A system boiler is a ‘sealed system’, so it can benefit from condensing technology. Condensing boilers recycle energy from the exhaust gasses your boiler emits to preheat the cold water, making the system even more energy-efficient.<br><br></p><h2>How is a <font color=\"#ff9c00\">system</font> boiler <font color=\"#ff9c00\">different</font> from a <font color=\"#ff9c00\">regular boiler</font>?</h2><p>System boilers are very similar to regular boilers as they both pre-heat water and store it in a separate storage cylinder.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><br></p><p>However, regular boilers require a cold water tank in the attic, rather than taking the cold water directly from the mains as it enters your home. Regular boilers are usually found in older homes, and they are often converted to combi boilers when the time comes to replace your boiler.</p><p><br>Regular boilers are kept under pressure with the use of a header tank in the loft (also called a feed &amp; expansion tank), whereas system boilers use a pressurised heating circuit, topped up by mains water.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Regular boilers use an external expansion vessel to maintain the water pressure, while the expansion vessel is often internal in a system boiler. Regular boilers use more space than a system boiler and often require more complex piping, which is why system boilers are more commonly used in modern properties with multiple bathrooms.</p><p><br>Most homes in the U.K choose to have a combi boiler fitted, you can choose to convert your system or regular boiler to a combi boiler when you complete the WarmZilla online survey to get your boiler quote. It only takes a few minutes and you’ll be given a selection of boilers to suit your home.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><h2>What comes with my <font color=\"#ff9c00\">system boiler</font> from <font color=\"#ff9c00\">WarmZilla</font>?</h2><p>Any system boiler purchased from WarmZilla comes with Gas Safe installation, system filter, system cleanse, inhibitor, smart thermostat, up to 12 years guarantee, any flues or extension kits you may need; plus, if your condensate or gas pipes require upgrading - that’s included in your fixed price regular boiler quote too!</p><p></p><p><br></p><p>You can choose to change your system boiler to a combi boiler or replace your system boiler for another system boiler using the <a href=\"https://www.warmzilla.co.uk/find-a-boiler\" target=\"_blank\">WarmZilla online survey</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>You can also add thermostatic radiator valves and radiators to your order - all your heating requirements with one easy online purchase.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Which <font color=\"#ff9c00\">system boiler</font> do I <font color=\"#ff9c00\">need</font>?</h2><p>What system boiler you need for your home depends on a few factors - how much you want to spend, what brand of boiler you like, the setup of your current boiler, and the size of your home.<br>System boilers usually run on natural gas, LPG, or oil.
